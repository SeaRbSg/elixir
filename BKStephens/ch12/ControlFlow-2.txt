I did not like my case solution to FizzBuzz because it uses a logic tree that I do not believe is as easy to understand at a glance. Both the cond and guard clause solutions to FizzBuzz work and are fairly easy to follow. I like the cond approach because I think someone coming from another language could more easily relate this control flow structure to something they have seen, as apposed to guard clauses. Guard clauses feel more like the Elixir way to do things. The guard clause solution is shorter than the cond solution, but I don't like having to retype the function name for each guard clause; I wish I could just type the method name once and then have multiple guard clauses.

I think I will be more likely to use guard clauses than cond, but I don't see a major benefit to one way over the other.
