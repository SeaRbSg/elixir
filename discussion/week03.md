# Seattle.Rb Elixir Study Group

## Discussion questions for week 3

1. Compare Elixir's "one function, multiple bodies" feature with method overloading in a language like Java/C++.

2. Write exercise Functions-4 in Ruby. Compare the solution with the one in Elixir. What are some similarities/differences between functions in Ruby and Elixir?

3. Explain how data encapsulation can be implemented with closures. Can you think of other common architectural problems that closures may be able to address?

4. Try choosing a simple algorithm and writing it using only what we've covered so far (data types, operators, and anonymous functions). What sort of capabilities do we have available, and what capabilities still seem to be missing?
