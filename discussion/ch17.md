## Discussion questions for chapter 17

1. In chapter 17, we wrote a stack server that utilizes a stash to save the stack value if the server process crashes. It was written with the assumption that the stash would be pretty stable. However, if for some reason the stash crashes, what would happen? Is this a problem, and if so, can you think of a way to address it?
