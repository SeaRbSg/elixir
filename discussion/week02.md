# Seattle.Rb Elixir Study Group

## Discussion questions for week 2

1. Compare pattern matching with traditional assignment? What could you do with pattern matching that might be more difficult with assignment?

2. Have you coded with immutable data before in other languages? What has your experience been like?

3. Is there anything you would not be able to do if all data is immutable? If so, how might you get around it?

4. Are there types available in other languages but not in Elixir? What Elixir type might you use instead?
