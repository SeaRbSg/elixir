## Discussion questions for week 5

## Some extra exercises for week 5

1. Try implementing as many of the list operations on page 73 as you can. Don't use any of the other List module functions in your implementations. (Or if you want to use a library function, implement it yourself first.) Do any patterns appear repeatedly in your implementations?

2. Try implementing a binary tree using lists. Implement search, and depth-first and breadth-first traversal. Can you implement binary trees without lists? What do you think the pros and cons of the two approaches are?

3. We should now have enough tools to implement some problems in Project Euler using Elixir. Try implementing a few of the early problems (up to problem 10) in both Elixir and Ruby. Compare your implementations for brevity and readability.
