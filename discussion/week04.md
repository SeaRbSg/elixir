# Seattle.Rb Elixir Study Group

## Discussion questions for week 4

1. In exercise 3, do you think there is any difference between implementing quadruple as: `Times.double(n) * 2` vs `Times.double(n) + Times.double(n)` ?

2. Describe Elixir's type system. Is it strongly/weakly/statically/dynamically typed? How is it similar or different from that of other languages that you know? (Java? Javascript? Ruby?)
