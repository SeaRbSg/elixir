defmodule Tanx.Core.Clock do

  @moduledoc """
  The Clock process implements a clock that sends a tick message to a recipient process
  on an interval schedule with millisecond accuracy.

  It waits for the recipient to acknowledge with a "tock" that it has completed processing
  before sending the next tick, to ensure that a long running periodic task doesn't overlap
  itself. As a result, the interval may be variable. For instance, suppose a clock is running
  with an interval of 20 milliseconds, and most tocks come back after 10 milliseconds, but
  one tock doesn't come back until 30 milliseconds after the tick. It might look like this:
  - **time=0** Tick sent
  - **time=10** Tock received (after 10 milliseconds)
  - **time=20** Tick sent (20 millisecond interval)
  - **time=30** Waiting for Tock... nothing happens...
  - **time=40** 20 milliseconds have elapsed, but no tock received yet, so tick not sent.
  - **time=50** Tock finally received (after 30 milliseconds this time). Tick sent immediately.
  - **time=60** Tock received (after 10 milliseconds)
  - **time=70** Tick sent (20 millisecond interval, but now offset)

  If you set the interval to nil, automatic ticks are disabled. You can then send manual
  ticks using the manual_tick function. This is useful for unit testing.
